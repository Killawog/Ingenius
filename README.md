Abstract:
We plan on developing a 2D platformer game that runs on android smartphones.
The game revolves around a character who has to run away from a monster and collect
items in game. It is an endless-runner type of game. The difficulty of the game increases as
you progress. The items that can be collected are health orbs, in-game currency and
powerups. We will be using the Unity 3D software to create the game. We will also be using
Blender and Krita to help us with level design.
